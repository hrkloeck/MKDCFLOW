MeerKAT Data Calibration workflow 

The idea is to provide on overview of the individual steps nesessary to generate a calibrated dataset and
a final image in radio continuum.

The emphasis is on gaining confidence what you are doing and to provide some ideas to sanity checks.

If you just what to get the thing done you could just use [oxkat](https://github.com/IanHeywood/oxkat) or  [caracal](https://github.com/caracal-pipeline/caracal).

Hi this is work in progress at the moment
1) check if you want it
2) check singularity at Stellenbosch  to build singularity images need fakeroot permission
3) get the sequence into git (hrk) and receipt for the singularity image
4) produce test MS data file (for test purposes)
5) start playing around


software that will be used in the future is
